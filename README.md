#FIND YOUR HAT

In this Codecademy project, I built an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

Required Features:

When a user runs main.js, they should be prompted for input and be able to indicate which direction they’d like to “move”.
After entering an instruction, the user should see a printed result of their current field map with the tiles they have visited marked with an asterisk. They should be prompted for their next move.
This should continue until the user either:

-Wins by finding their hat.
-Loses by landing on (and falling in) a hole.
-Attempts to move “outside” the field.

When any of the above occur, the user is notified and the game ends.

ADDED Features:

-Character starts in a random location instead of the upper left
-'Hard mode' where a new hole is added after every move
-color graphics
-field validator to ensure that the generated field is solvable
-scoreboard
-upon game completion, player is asked if they want to play again.
